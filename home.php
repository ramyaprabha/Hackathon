                        in developing this earthquake. Our Mentor Mr.Senathipathi K is the Strength of our team.

                        statistics of India show that almost 54% of the land is vulnerable to earthquakes. </p>

                        concerned State and Central Government agencies responsible for carrying out relief and rehabilitation measures.The earthquake information is transmitted to public information channels, press, media etc. and posted on IMDâ€™s Website.</p>

                        describe a 2D display depicting financial market information, though similar plots such as shading matrices have existed for over a century</p>
